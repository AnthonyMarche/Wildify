# Wildify - Music streaming website

## Description

This repository is a five-week PHP MVC project realized in 2022 as part of a study project, at the Wild Code School, Bordeaux (FR).

The main objective for the team was to build a website mostly inspired by Spotify and, more importantly, to put into practice some concepts such as:
- website conception (brainstormimng, wireframes...)
- MVC architecture
- OOP
- Twig
- Database designing
- Complete CRUD (user + tracks)
- Sessions
- Manage API connection (in this case, Spotify)
- Teamwork (Agile Scrum method, Git WorkFlow)
- ...

## The team
- Hélène Fourcade
- Alexis Boucherie
- Andy Ricana
- Anthony Marché
- Bixente Lasserre

## Steps to launch the project on your computer

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Create *config/db.php* from *config/db.php.dist* file and add your DB parameters. Don't delete the *.dist* file, it must be kept.
```php
define('APP_DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
define('APP_DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('APP_DB_USER', 'your_db_user_which_is_not_root');
define('APP_DB_PASSWORD', 'your_db_password');
```
4. Go to Spotify for Devs (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and click on "create an app" to ask for your own credentials (clientID & clientSecret). Add them to your *db.php*. This will allow you to get an access token from Spotify while using Wildify App and access all music related actions.
```php
define('CLIENT_ID', 'your_client_id');
define('CLIENT_SECRET', 'your_client_secret');
```
5. Optionnal: If you'd like to use the "send mail" option, you have to create a double factor authentication in your Gmail account and generate an "app password". When ready, add your credentials to your *db.php*.
```php
define('MAIL_USER NAME', 'your_email');
define('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'your_password');
```
6. Import *database.sql* in your SQL server, you can do it manually or use the *migration.php* script which will import a *database.sql* file.
7. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
8. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
9. Register as a new User on the registration page or create a new user from scratch, directly in your database (an "admin" role is required to have full access to all features)
10. One last thing: you can add your own music to the app. Just know that you are limited to 2Mo per track, unless you go to your *php.ini* and change the "maximum_upload_size" allowed.
11. After these steps, you should be able to access the whole website. Have fun!
